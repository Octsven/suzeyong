### Introduction
Self-Introduction: I am interested in understanding how we can reliably quantify uncertainty and robustness in modern, complex data analysis procedure. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian inference and graphical models-with an emphasis on scalable, nonparametric, and unsupervised learning. In addition, the primary challenge that has been driving my research is the need for designing highperformance, extremely effective algorithms under severe resource constraints. And my current focus includes modelling irregular time series and tensor decomposition applied in model compression.

Sikll: Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras
